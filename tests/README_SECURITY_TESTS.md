## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install psutil  # For memory tests
```

### Run All Security Tests
```bash
python tests/run_security_tests.py
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Core tests
python -m unittest tests.test_core

# Comprehensive security tests
python -m unittest tests.test_security_comprehensive

# Service security tests
python -m unittest tests.test_service_security

# Filesystem security tests
python -m unittest tests.test_filesystem_security

# Integration tests
python -m unittest tests.test_integration_security
```

### Run Specific Test Classes
```bash
# Test privilege escalation only
python -m unittest tests.test_security_comprehensive.TestPrivilegeEscalation

# Test input sanitization only
python -m unittest tests.test_security_comprehensive.TestInputSanitization
```

## Test Reports

After running the security test suite, a detailed report is generated in `test_reports/` directory containing:
- Test execution summary
- Security issues found
- Severity assessment
- Recommendations for improvements

## Security Considerations

### High Priority Issues
These tests check for critical vulnerabilities:
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Injection attacks (SQL, Command, XSS)
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Credential exposure
- Authentication bypasses

### Medium Priority Issues
These tests validate important security measures:
- File permission issues
- Encryption implementation
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Memory security

### Low Priority Issues
These tests check for best practices:
- Logging completeness
- Performance under attack
- Resource cleanup

## Continuous Security Testing

### Pre-Commit Hooks
Add to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
python tests/run_security_tests.py
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Security tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add to your CI pipeline:
```yaml
security_tests:
  script:
    - python tests/run_security_tests.py
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - test_reports/
```

## Interpreting Results

### Success Criteria
- **90%+ Pass Rate**: Excellent security posture
- **70-89% Pass Rate**: Good security with improvements needed
- **50-69% Pass Rate**: Fair security, significant work required
- **<50% Pass Rate**: Critical security issues present

### Common Failures and Solutions

1. **Permission Issues on Windows**
   - Run tests as Administrator for full coverage
   - Some tests may skip on non-admin accounts

2. **Network Tests Failing**
   - Ensure internet connectivity for DNS tests
   - Some tests require specific ports available

3. **File System Tests**
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Close antivirus that may interfere

## Security Best Practices Validated

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Service runs with minimal required permissions
   - Privileges dropped after initialization

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security validation
   - Input validation at every boundary

3. **Secure by Default**
   - Restrictive file permissions
   - Encrypted credential storage
   - HTTPS enforcement

4. **Fail Securely**
   - Graceful error handling
   - No information disclosure on failure

5. **Audit and Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive security event logging
   - Tamper-evident audit trails

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test in appropriate module
2. Follow naming convention: `test_security_feature()`
3. Include security context in docstrings
4. Update this README

### Updating Security Policies
When security requirements change:
1. Update relevant test assertions
2. Document changes in commit message
3. Re-run full test suite
4. Update recommendations

## Support

For security concerns or test failures:
1. Check test output for specific error details
2. Review recommendations in test report
3. Consult security best practices documentation
4. Consider security audit for production deployment
